# Week 2: Market Research & Validation

## Building on Your Problem Foundation
Welcome to Week 2! Last week, you identified compelling problems. This week, we're going to validate whether these problems represent real market opportunities worth pursuing.

## The Validation Imperative
Having a problem isn't enough - you need to prove that enough people experience this problem intensely enough to pay for a solution. This week transforms your problem hypotheses into validated market insights.

## What You'll Master This Week
- Market sizing techniques to quantify your opportunity
- Competitive landscape analysis to understand existing solutions
- Customer segmentation to identify your ideal target market
- Demand validation methods to prove people will pay
- Data collection and analysis frameworks for informed decision-making

## Deep Dive into Market Research
You'll learn both quantitative and qualitative research methods. From surveys and focus groups to market analysis and trend research, you'll build a comprehensive understanding of your market landscape.

## Competitive Intelligence
Understanding your competition isn't about copying - it's about finding gaps and opportunities. We'll teach you how to analyze competitors' strengths and weaknesses, identify market white spaces, and position your future solution effectively.

## Customer Segmentation Mastery
Not all customers are created equal. This week, you'll learn to identify and prioritize customer segments based on problem intensity, willingness to pay, and accessibility. You'll create detailed customer personas that guide all future decisions.

## Validation Frameworks
We'll introduce proven validation frameworks including the Mom Test for customer interviews, market sizing methodologies, and demand validation techniques. These tools ensure your research leads to actionable insights.

## Real-World Examples
Study how companies like Slack validated the problem of team communication inefficiency, and how Zoom identified the market need for reliable video conferencing. These cases demonstrate validation in action.

## Week 2 Deliverable
You'll create a comprehensive market validation report that proves your problem represents a significant market opportunity. This report becomes your business foundation and investor pitch starting point.

## Data-Driven Decisions
By week's end, you'll have the data and insights needed to make informed decisions about which problem to pursue. Remember: in entrepreneurship, opinions are cheap, but validated insights are invaluable.
