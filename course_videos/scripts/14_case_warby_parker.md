# Case Study: Warby Parker - Disrupting the Eyewear Industry

## The Expensive Eyewear Problem
In 2008, four Wharton MBA students identified a glaring problem: eyeglasses were ridiculously expensive due to industry monopolization. A product that cost $20 to manufacture was selling for $200-$500, making vision correction unaffordable for many people.

## Founders' Frustration
Neil Blumenthal, Andrew Hunt, David Gilboa, and Jeffrey Raider experienced this problem personally. When co-founder Dave Gilboa lost his glasses and faced a $700 replacement cost, they realized this was a systemic problem affecting millions of people.

## PSIF Framework: Problem Identification
The founders discovered that Luxottica controlled nearly 80% of the eyewear market, from manufacturing to retail. This monopoly created artificial scarcity and inflated prices while limiting style options and innovation.

## Market Research and Validation
Their research revealed that consumers were frustrated with limited selection, high prices, and poor retail experiences. Many people were delaying necessary vision correction due to cost, creating a significant unmet market need.

## Solution Design Innovation
Warby Parker's solution was elegantly simple: cut out middlemen by designing glasses in-house, manufacturing directly, and selling online. They would offer designer-quality frames at a fraction of traditional retail prices.

## The Home Try-On Revolution
Their breakthrough innovation was the Home Try-On program. Customers could select five frames online, try them at home for five days, then purchase their favorites. This solved the biggest barrier to online eyewear shopping.

## Business Model Disruption
Warby Parker's direct-to-consumer model eliminated retailer markups while maintaining healthy margins. They could offer $95 glasses that competed with $300 designer frames while still building a profitable business.

## Brand and Mission Integration
From the beginning, Warby Parker integrated social impact into their business model. For every pair sold, they distribute a pair to someone in need through their "Buy a Pair, Give a Pair" program.

## Technology and User Experience
The company invested heavily in technology to create seamless online experiences, from virtual try-on tools to prescription verification systems that made online eyewear shopping as easy as buying books.

## Go-to-Market Strategy
Warby Parker launched with a carefully curated selection of stylish, affordable frames marketed to young professionals. They focused on building a strong brand identity that resonated with socially conscious consumers.

## Scaling Challenges
As demand exploded, Warby Parker faced challenges in inventory management, customer service, and maintaining quality while scaling manufacturing. They had to build operational capabilities to match their marketing success.

## Omnichannel Evolution
While starting online-only, Warby Parker strategically expanded to physical retail, opening showrooms and stores that enhanced rather than cannibalized their online business.

## Competitive Response
Established players initially dismissed Warby Parker as a niche online player. By the time they recognized the threat, Warby Parker had built significant brand loyalty and operational advantages.

## Operational Excellence
The company built sophisticated supply chain and customer service operations, including in-house customer service teams and quality control processes that maintained their premium brand experience.
