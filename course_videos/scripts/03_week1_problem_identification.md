# Week 1: Problem Identification

## Welcome to Week 1
Welcome to the first week of your entrepreneurial journey! This week, we're diving deep into the foundation of all successful businesses: identifying real problems that people are willing to pay to solve.

## The Problem-First Mindset
Too many entrepreneurs fall in love with their solutions before understanding the problems they're trying to solve. This week, we'll flip that approach. You'll learn to become a problem detective, uncovering opportunities that others miss.

## What You'll Learn This Week
- How to identify problems worth solving versus problems that seem interesting but lack market potential
- Customer interview techniques that reveal genuine pain points
- Market research methods to validate problem significance
- Tools for documenting and prioritizing problems
- Common pitfalls in problem identification and how to avoid them

## Key Activities
You'll conduct your first customer interviews, analyze market trends, and begin building your problem validation framework. By the end of this week, you'll have identified at least three potential problems that could form the foundation of a business.

## Real-World Application
We'll examine how companies like Airbnb identified the problem of expensive, impersonal travel accommodations, and how Uber recognized the frustration with traditional taxi services. These case studies will show you how to spot problems hiding in plain sight.

## Tools and Resources
This week introduces you to essential entrepreneurial tools including customer interview templates, problem validation frameworks, and market research databases. You'll also learn to use AI tools like ChatGPT to enhance your research process.

## Week 1 Deliverable
Your week culminates in creating a comprehensive problem statement that clearly articulates a validated market problem. This becomes the foundation for everything you'll build in subsequent weeks.

## Setting the Stage
Remember, the best entrepreneurs aren't necessarily the most creative - they're the best problem identifiers. This week sets the stage for your entire entrepreneurial journey. Let's discover the problems that will drive your success.
