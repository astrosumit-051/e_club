## Case Study 5: TOMS - A Business Model for a Better Tomorrow

### Company Background

TOMS is a unique company built on a foundation of social entrepreneurship. Founded in 2006 by Blake Mycoskie, the company is famous for pioneering the **One for One® business model**, a revolutionary concept that integrated philanthropy directly into its for-profit operations. Initially focused on shoes, TOMS promised that for every pair of its signature *alpargata*-style canvas shoes sold, it would donate a pair to a child in need. This simple yet powerful idea resonated globally, transforming TOMS into a cultural phenomenon and inspiring a new generation of socially conscious businesses. While the company has since evolved its giving model, its core identity remains rooted in using business as a force for good, with a current focus on supporting mental health initiatives by dedicating one-third of its profits to grassroots organizations.

### The Problem: Identifying a Market Gap

The inspiration for TOMS struck Blake Mycoskie during a 2006 vacation in Argentina. While traveling, he met an American woman who was volunteering for a shoe drive. She explained the dire reality for countless children in developing countries who lacked shoes. This was not a matter of comfort, but of survival and opportunity. Without shoes, children were vulnerable to soil-transmitted diseases, cuts, and infections. Furthermore, many schools required shoes as part of the uniform, meaning a lack of footwear was a direct barrier to education. Mycoskie joined the volunteers and witnessed this problem firsthand. He saw the practical limitations of traditional charity: the reliance on donations was often inconsistent, and donated shoes frequently did not match the sizes needed. The problem he identified was twofold: the immediate, critical need for shoes among children, and the inherent unsustainability of a donation-based charity model to solve it consistently.

### The Solution: Crafting an Innovative Offering

Mycoskie’s initial thought was to start his own charity. However, his entrepreneurial instincts quickly led him to a more sustainable idea. He realized that a for-profit business could create a constant, reliable flow of shoes, independent of the whims of donors. His solution was to create a shoe company that would sell a product in one market to fund giving in another. The product itself was inspired by his travels: the *alpargata*, a simple, comfortable canvas shoe worn by nearly everyone in Argentina. He adapted the design to appeal to an American market, making it more durable and stylish. He then created a simple, powerful promise: for every pair of TOMS shoes he sold, his company would give a new pair to a child in need. This was the birth of the One for One model. The company's name itself, derived from "Shoes for a Better Tomorrow," encapsulated this promise.

### The Innovation: Business Model and Value Proposition

The core innovation of TOMS was the **One for One® business model**. At a time when corporate social responsibility was often an afterthought or a separate foundation, Mycoskie embedded giving into the very DNA of his company's transactions. This was a radical paradigm shift. It transformed customers from passive consumers into active participants in a social mission. Every purchase had a direct, tangible, and easily understood impact. This created an incredibly powerful value proposition that appealed to a growing movement of ethical consumerism, particularly among millennials. The story behind the brand—a young entrepreneur's journey of discovery and a promise to help children—was as compelling as the product itself. This narrative became the company's most powerful marketing tool, creating a deep emotional connection with customers and fostering immense brand loyalty. The model was so innovative that it effectively created a new category of business and inspired countless "copycat" companies, from Warby Parker to Bombas.

### Growth and Scaling Strategies

TOMS's growth was driven almost entirely by its powerful story. Operating out of his Venice apartment, Mycoskie sold 10,000 pairs in the first summer. The brand's breakthrough came after a feature article in the *Los Angeles Times*, which generated thousands of orders overnight. This was quickly followed by features in major fashion magazines like *Vogue* and endorsements from celebrities, who were drawn to the brand's style and social mission. This organic, word-of-mouth publicity was invaluable and propelled the brand into national retailers like Nordstrom. Mycoskie scaled the business by building a community around the brand, encouraging customers to share the TOMS story. He expanded the One for One model to other products, including eyewear (donating sight-saving surgery or glasses) and coffee (donating clean water), further broadening the company's impact and appeal.

### Navigating Challenges and Adversity

Despite its incredible success, TOMS faced significant challenges. The One for One model, while popular, drew criticism from some economists and development experts. They argued that giving away free products could create dependency and undermine local economies by putting local shoemakers out of business. This critique forced the company to evolve its approach, eventually moving to produce some of its shoes in the countries where it donated them to create jobs. By 2014, the company's rapid growth had also led to internal challenges, including a bloated corporate structure and a culture that had lost its initial spark. Facing stagnant growth, Mycoskie made the difficult decision to sell 50% of TOMS to private equity firm Bain Capital to bring in professional management and financial discipline. This led to a strategic shift and, eventually, an evolution of the giving model itself. In 2019, acknowledging the complexities of social impact, TOMS moved away from the strict One for One product donation, transitioning to its current model of donating one-third of its profits to support a wider range of grassroots initiatives.

### Key Entrepreneurial Lessons

Blake Mycoskie's journey with TOMS offers profound lessons in social entrepreneurship. First, it shows the immense power of a **simple, compelling, and authentic story**. The origin story of TOMS was its greatest asset. Second, it demonstrates that **integrating a social mission into the core business model** can be a powerful competitive advantage and a driver of customer loyalty. Third, the evolution of TOMS's giving model highlights the importance of **listening to criticism and being willing to adapt**. A successful social enterprise must be open to learning and evolving its approach to maximize its positive impact. Finally, the sale to Bain Capital illustrates that even visionary founders may need to **bring in outside expertise** to navigate the complexities of scale and ensure the long-term sustainability of their mission.

### PSIF Alignment Summary

TOMS is a quintessential example of the Problem-Solution Innovation Framework applied to social entrepreneurship. Blake Mycoskie identified a critical **Problem**: children in developing nations lacked shoes, and the traditional charity model was an unsustainable way to help them. He devised a for-profit **Solution**: a shoe company that sold stylish canvas shoes to consumers and used the proceeds to provide a consistent supply of new shoes to children in need. The groundbreaking **Innovation** was the One for One® business model itself, which inextricably linked commerce with philanthropy and created a powerful, story-driven brand that empowered consumers to be part of the solution. This framework allowed TOMS to not only build a successful company but also to launch a global movement in social enterprise.
